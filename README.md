# Playlist-Converter
The end goal of this project is to be able to convert playlists from Spotify and Youtube. Not just searching for the name of the songs, but actually comparing the audio to make sure it's the right song before adding it to the destination playlist. Reason this is needed is because there is a high chance the searched song could be a remix, a cover, a live performance or  a different song from a different artist entirely.
