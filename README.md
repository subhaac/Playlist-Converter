# Youtube to Spotify Playlist
The end goal of this project is to be able to move playlists from Spotify and Youtube. Not just searching for the name of the songs, but actually comparing the audio to make sure it's the right song before adding it to the destination playlist. Reason this is needed is because there is a high chance the searched song could be a remix, a cover, a live performance or  a different song from a different artist entirely. 

Things the app can do now...
1. Able to authenticate user on Spotify using OAuth
2. Able to get user's liked songs on Spotify 
3. Able to create a new playlist on Spotify
4. Able to get list of song URLs from a Youtube playlist URL
5. Able to get track names and artist name for all of the songs from the Youtube playlist. This is used to search for a song on Spotify.
6. Able to get Spotify URI for all these tracks. 
7. Able to add the songs to the created Spotify playlist using the URIs for the songs.


NOTES:

a) The Youtube playlist must be public
